# Project-SNEAKii

//Overall Idea

Develop an messaging app with *visually* encrypted messaging to promote good privacy and security. User will enter the app and be prompted with a passcode (This may be a number passcode, a pattern passcode, etc. The final design is to be determined, or may be modular by the user under paywall) regardless of the validity of the passcode, the user will be entered into the app. The user will be able to choose the person, or groups of people they wish to message. The user will input their text and click "Send". The text will then be encrypted by a random encryption. Within this message, a decryption key will be implemented (After the first vowel inside of the text, or if the text is without a vowel it will appear at the very end of the text.) if the user has entered the password correctly, they will be prompted with a button saying "Decrypt" next to the encrypted text, which will return the text to the original value sent by the sender. If the user did not enter the passcode correctly, the text will NOT have a "Decrypt" button, making the entire conversation nonsensical. The user will be prompted with a password at every re-entry of the app OVER 2 minutes.

//Code Details

Project SNEAKii will be developed in two different languages led by a team of two programmers each coding in their specific coding language. For the development of the Android version of the app, the Python coding language will be used. The Import function associated within Python will allow for random encryption keys to be quickly and securely developed. For the IOS version of Project SNEAKii, I will be using the SWIFT coding language. This is due primarily in part due to the lack of freedom associated with coding within the Apple ecosystem. Despite the differences in the coding languages, these apps will be near identical with the main differences being possible UI differences based on the features associated with the respective phones. (e.g. many Android phones have a built in "back-button" which will eliminate the need for an integrated back button within the Android version of the application.)

//UI Development

The UI for Project SNEAKii will be prototyped, designed, edited, reviewed, and finalized within the Figma (https://www.figma.com/) UI/UX designer. After the finalization of the UI/UX of the app, the style will then be exported into both the SWIFT and Python code. Figma will be used due to the relative ease as opposed to intricately designing every aspect of Project SNEAKii within the code.

//Revenue Generation

Project SNEAKii will be a FOR PROFIT organization, many extra (however not necessary) features will be locked behind paywalls, to help recuperate some of the costs associated with developing, and publishing mobile apps. These paywall features could include, but are not limited to... Different encryption patterns (Shapes, colors, only numbers, etc.), different app icons, different in app styles, the ability to encrypt images (HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL), an infinite character limit, different UI designs, the ability to create the users own encryption pattern (unlikely) etc. User data will also be collected and sold, this is done as a safeguard to help recuperate the bare minimum costs.

//Reason for development

Project SNEAKii will be a great way to display my educational dedication and financial management skills, which may help improve college applications, intern applications, job applications, and more. Project SNEAKii may also be used as a primary income source for the developers if the app gains enough traction.
